		<p>This page explains what to do in the evaluation step.</p>

  <h2 class="title2">Page overview</h2>
 </div>
		<hr/>
		The initial view of this page provides you with <ul>
		<li>an objective tree on the upper left,</li>
		<li>a matrix of sample objects and experiment results on the lower left, </li>
		<li>and an empty space saying "No leaves selected" on the top right, </li>
		</ul>as shown below.
		<br/>
		<img src="screen-evaluate0.png" alt="Initial view"/><br/>
	<p>
	The task of this page is to provide all evaluation values for every criterion that you have defined in the tree.<br/>
	This means both experimental outcomes judging migration quality or the performance of an emulator, as well certain characteristics of the tool, the process, etc...<br/>
	Some of these evaluation values might be provided by automated measurement tools; we are working on increasing the percentage of these.<br/> However, currently you still have to enter many of them manually.<br/>
	The tree on the top left provides a way of selecting areas in the tree to filter the list of leaves. If you click on the root, the right side will disaply all leaves;<br/> 
	if you select a certain branch, it will display all leaf criteria in this branch.  
	</p>
		
		<p>
		You can expand the tree on the top left to get the screen below:
		</p>
		<img src="screen-evaluate1.png" alt="Initial view with expanded tree"/><br/>
		
		
		<p>
		Now selecting a node will display all leaf criteria under this node and prompt you for evaluation values.
		</p>		
		<img src="screen-evaluate2.png" alt="Selection of leaves"/>
		<p>
		To support the evaluation, you have full access to the original sample objects and the results that were created during the experiments - either uploaded by yourself or generated by preservation actions.<br/>
		You can download the original samples on the top of the table and each result file in the corresponding cell of the matrix.
		</p>
		<p>
		You can further get visual support for judging the quality of migration actions by comparing the charateristics of input and output files extracted by Jhove.<br/> 
		Clicking on the matrix in the lower left will bring up a screen that shows the characteristics of original and converted objects side by side, as shown below.
		</p>
 	   <img src="screen-evaluate-jhove.png" alt="Selection of leaves"/>
		<p>
		For reasons of traceability and auditing, Plato checks that each evaluation field has actually been entered.
		So you have to either manually specify a value for each field or <i>confirm</i> the evaluation data by clicking <em>Approve all values</em> before you can proceed to the next step.

		If you have defined mappings to automated measurements in the objective tree, you will see the following button appear:
	</p>
		<img src="screen-evaluate-button.png" alt="Automated comparison button"/>
		<p>
			Clicking it executes the automated comparison engine based on the XCL tool suite. Please note that this works only for specific file formats and migration experiments.<br/>
			The defined mappings also appear in the list of leaves, with their full configuration description, as shown bellow.
