# Plato: The Preservation Planning Tool

Efficient and trustworthy preservation planning.

## How to install and use

### Requirements

To install you need:

* Java 7
* MySQL 5 Server
* JBoss AS 7.1.0.Final

### Download

At the moment there are no precompiled versions available, please refer to the instructions for building Plato on the contribute page.

### Install instructions

To install follow these steps:

1. Install and setup MySQL server 
	1. Install MySQL 5 Server (tested with version 5.1.54)
	2. Set UTF8 as a default encoding/collation. 
	   Check appropriate MySQL 5.X reference manual for instruction on how to do this. There were some changes so it might not be the same for all versions. 
	3. Configuration
	   Make the following changes in your MySQL config file (on Linux it is my.cnf and on Windows my.ini)
	    <pre>
	     #in the Server Section [mysqld] 
	     max_allowed_packet = 128M
	     max_sp_recursion_depth = 255
	     thread_stack = 512K
	    </pre> 
	4. Restart MySQL server 

2. Setup Database for Planning Suite
	If you run Planning Suite and IDP on the same domain, you can use a predefined script:
	
	1. Switch to the _tools_ directory, there you will find the script setup-database.sh.
	   It creates DB users and databases for IDP and Plato, and prepares a config file for your JBoss AS 7 server. 
	2. Run it via
	   `./setup-database.sh <MySQL root password> <Plato DB password> <IDP DB password>`
	3. You will find two new files in this directory: standalone.xml for your production environment, adjust it to your needs, and additionally standalone-test.xml - the configuration for your test server.

3. Install and setup JBoss AS 7
	1. Download and install JBoss AS 7.1.0.Final. 
	   You can use JBoss AS 7.1.1.Final, but there are [issues with the included JSF implementation] (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7-4366), so you have to replace the corresponding modules yourself.
	2. Copy the file standalone.xml you have generated during database setup to  [JBOSS_HOME]/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml


4. Install MySQL Drivers
	1. Download [MySQL Connector/J] (http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j)
	2. Create a driver module as described in [Installing a JDBC driver as a module] (https://community.jboss.org/wiki/DataSourceConfigurationInAS7#Installing_a_JDBC_driver_as_a_module)

5. Install and setup PicketLink 
	1. Go to the modules/org/picketlink/main directory and delete all jar files in it.
	2. Download Picketlink 2.1.4 jars for JBoss AS 7.1.x here: [picketlink-core-2.1.4.Final.jar](https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/public/org/picketlink/picketlink-core/2.1.4.Final/picketlink-core-2.1.4.Final.jar) and 
	[picketlink-jbas7-2.1.4.Final.jar](https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/public/org/picketlink/distribution/picketlink-jbas7/2.1.4.Final/picketlink-jbas7-2.1.4.Final.jar)
	3. Copy both Picketlink 2.1.4 jars into modules/org/picketlink/main directory
	4. In modules/org/picketlink/main do the following changes to the module.xml file :
	   <pre> 
	&lt;module xmlns="urn:jboss:module:1.1" name="org.picketlink"&gt;
	    &lt;resources&gt;
	        &lt;resource-root path="picketlink-core-2.1.4.Final.jar"/&gt;
	        &lt;resource-root path="picketlink-jbas7-2.1.4.Final.jar"/&gt;
	    &lt;/resources&gt;
	    &lt;dependencies&gt;
	        &lt;module name="javax.api"/&gt;
	        &lt;module name="javax.security.auth.message.api"/&gt;
	        &lt;module name="javax.security.jacc.api"/&gt;
	        &lt;module name="javax.transaction.api"/&gt;
	        &lt;module name="javax.xml.bind.api"/&gt;
	        &lt;module name="javax.xml.stream.api"/&gt;
	        &lt;module name="javax.servlet.api"/&gt;
	        &lt;module name="org.jboss.common-core"/&gt;
	        &lt;module name="org.jboss.logging"/&gt;
	        &lt;module name="org.jboss.as.web"/&gt;
	        &lt;module name="org.jboss.security.xacml"/&gt;
	        &lt;module name="org.picketbox"/&gt;
	        &lt;module name="javax.xml.ws.api"/&gt;
	        &lt;module name="org.apache.log4j"/&gt;
	        &lt;module name="org.apache.santuario.xmlsec"/&gt;
	    &lt;/dependencies&gt;
	&lt;/module&gt;
	  </pre>
